# COMP60012 - CW1 Decision Tree Coursework

The goal of this assignment is to implement a decision tree learning algorithm that identifies one of four indoor rooms based on the strengths of six WiFi signal sources. This repository contains the code for the algorithm, and its results are discussed seperately in the report.

## Instructions for running the code on lab machines
In the command line navigate to the folder containing `main.py`

Run the following to start the venv:

``source /vol/lab/intro2ml/venv/bin/activate``

Run the following to run the code using the clean dataset:

``python3 main.py c``

Run the following to run the code using the noisy dataset:

``python3 main.py n``
